Complete PixelAirDevice Control Example

This example demonstrates the proper PixelAir architecture:
1. PixelAirClient listens on port 12345 for state packets from devices
2. PixelAirDevice sends OSC commands to device on port 6767
3. Device automatically responds with state updates sent to client on port 12345
4. Client routes state packets to the appropriate PixelAirDevice instance

Architecture Flow:
- PixelAirDevice.set_power(True) ‚Üí OSC command to device:6767
- Device receives command and updates its state
- Device sends state packet to client:12345
- Client routes packet to PixelAirDevice.handle_state_packet()

Usage:
    python basic_fluora_example.py
